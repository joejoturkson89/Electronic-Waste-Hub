Electronic Waste Hub
E-Waste disposal for reward

TEAM George Joejo Turkson - Aspiring full stack software engineer.

TECHNOLOGIES HTML, CSS, Java Script, Python, GitHub, Restful API.

I decided to work with GitHub over other version control applications because GitHub offers a lot of add-ons for increasing development productivity and improving collaboration and also GitHub has a faster performance and I am more familiar with GitHub than other version control applications.

PROBLEMS In my country Ghana now,there is a pressing issue with electronic waste disposal and waste disposal generally. Most individuals and organizations dispose off their electronic waste together with other waste because of lack of education on the need to separate waste according to the materials and for those with the education on proper waste disposal, there are no designated disposal points for electronic waste disposal. Another alternate avenue for electronic waste disposal is individual waste collectors going around, from house to house, neighborhood to neighborhood to collect E-waste and how these individuals dispose of the waste is far from appropriate.

What this project tends to do is to provide individuals and organizations a platform to find e-waste disposal points near them and educate them on the dangers of indiscriminate e-waste disposal. Users who access this platform for their waste disposal will build points that can be retrieved after accumulating points to a certain amount.

RISKS The non technical risks will be creating awareness on the need for proper disposal of e-waste and the usage of the designated collection/disposal points. Individuals might be a bit skeptical in the beginning because their data will be collected to add in the point building and rewards and people might take advantage of others by charging them a fee even when it's free to dispose of the e-waste at the disposal points.

The technical risks that can be faced in the early stages are overflow on the database and Web browser compatibility issues.

INFRASTRUCTURE Minimal Continuous INtegration will be used, admins will upload their initial data to test the platform's functionality and for testing unittest will be used.

Users will provide their data to help with the rewards and points accumulation, which they can see on their dashboard when they sign into their accounts on the platform The workers at the various points will also be able to sign into their workers accounts so they can input details of users when they drop off their e-waste , that is - what kind of e-waste did they dispose of , the weight of the item being disposed of and points accumulated.

EXISTING SOLUTION Zoomlion - Zoomlion is waste management company in Ghana but they don't concentrate on e-waste Individual Waste Collectors - they mainly don't collect e-waste and when they do, dont dispose of them appropriately.
